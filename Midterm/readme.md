Here you'll find all 3 parts of my midterm assignment


Also note that I've attached 4 images of my scatterplots from Part 1, as they would not save in the PDF of my Jupyter notebook.
* Percent Delinquent Population by Median Household Income 
* Percent Delinquent Population by Percent Poverty 
* Percent Delinquent Population by Percent Black
* Percent Delinquent Population by Percent Hispanic

You'll also see the html file of my Kepler map, which did not fit in the PDF of my output. You can find the link (here)[https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/user/jaadams17@g.ucla.edu/view/Delinquent%20and%20Demographics.html] and I've attached a .zip file (because the .html was too large to upload to my GitHub). But let me know if there are any issues viewing that. 

I uploaded the work I did on mapping COVID cases by county last week (Exploratory Lab Week 4), although I need to refine this analysis and conduct it by zip code (assuming I can find the right data). 

Finally, you can find a link to my Google Sheets Presentation, (here)[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MULKHSRmpEatQeI35b0E3zmz8YR_a0XF4qmk8KKpzlQ/edit?usp=sharing]
