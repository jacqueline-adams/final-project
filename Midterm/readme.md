Here you'll find all 3 parts of my midterm assignment


Also note that I've attached 4 images of my scatterplots from Part 1, as they would not save in the PDF of my Jupyter notebook.
* Percent Delinquent Population by Median Household Income 
* Percent Delinquent Population by Percent Poverty 
* Percent Delinquent Population by Percent Black
* Percent Delinquent Population by Percent Hispanic

You'll also see the html file of my Kepler map, (here)[https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/user/jaadams17@g.ucla.edu/view/Delinquent%20and%20Demographics.html]

Finally, I uploaded the work I did on mapping COVID cases by county, although I need to refine this analysis and conduct it by zip code (assuming I can find 
the right data).
